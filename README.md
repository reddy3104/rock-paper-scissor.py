# Rock Paper Scissors - Python Console Game

This is a simple Rock Paper Scissors game created using Python.  
I built this project while learning Python to practice basic concepts like loops, conditionals, user input, and functions.

## Why I Built This

I'm learning Python and wanted to build something small that still uses real logic.  
This project helped me apply what I learned in a fun way.  
It also helped me understand how to structure a small program with clean code.

## What I Learned

- How to use `input()` to take user input
- Using `if`, `elif`, and `else` for decision-making
- How to use `while True` and `break` to control loops
- How to use the `random` module to simulate the AI
- How to use formatted strings (`f""`) to print output nicely
- Using basic string methods like `.lower()`
- How to upload a Python project to GitHub

## Game Features

- Play rock, paper, or scissor against the AI
- The AI randomly selects a choice each round
- Tracks your score and the AI's score
- Prints the final result when you type `exit`
- Input validation (shows error if input is wrong)

---

## How the Game Works

1. You enter your choice: rock, paper, or scissor
2. The AI randomly chooses one of the three
3. The program compares both choices and shows the result
4. Scores are updated, and the next round begins
5. You can type `exit` anytime to stop the game and see final results

## My Learning Journey

This is one of my first practice projects in Python.  
I plan to build more small games and tools to improve my skills.  
Some next projects I have in mind:
- A number guessing game
- A simple calculator
- A quiz app
- A to-do list app
